			<p>I am passionate about genealogy. This website is planned to contain a copy of my family tree in the future.</p>
			<p>My ancestry consists of:
				<ul>
					<li>Czech branches from multiple areas of Central Bohemia, each including its vicinity:
						<ul>
							<li>Příbram,</li>
							<li>Kozárovice, in the area between Příbram and Písek,</li>
							<li>Rožmitál pod Třemšínem,</li>
							<li>Hořovice and nearby Hvozdec and Strašice,</li>
							<li>Červený Hrádek near Kolín,</li>
						</ul>
					some ancestors from these branches have arrived in the area of Most (where I would later grow up) around the year 1900 for work in coal mines and settled there,</li>
					<li>a German branch from Northern Bohemia, specifically the area of Šluknov, with arrivals from multiple places in Germany in the distant past,</li>
					<li>a Moravian branch from Topolná near Uherské Hradiště.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>Important sources: church and civil records, as well as census operates, mostly from today's Czech Republic. Digitized records available through regional archives, see <a href="https://ebadatelna.soapraha.cz/" target="_blank">link</a>.</p>
